# Web Development Roadmap Part 4

Hello friends! Last week we covered the JavaScript learner's roadmap, the link for that blog can be found here:

This week I am going to share some best beginner-friendly ideas for anyone new to JavaScript programming and trying to understand some key concepts but have nowhere to search for some projects. Remember the purpose of learning any programming language is to solve a particular problem mostly by trying to automate various human repetitive tasks. I will list ten such projects in no particular order and I believe anyone can pick any project and finish within a couple of days.

## JavaScript Project Ideas

1.  **<mark>A simple to-do list app</mark>**: This project would allow users to add, edit, and delete tasks from a list. It could also include features like marking tasks as complete and setting reminders.
    
2.  **<mark>A weather forecast app</mark>**: This project would allow users to enter their location and display current weather conditions as well as a forecast for the next few days.
    
3.  **<mark>A quote generator</mark>**: This project would display a random quote each time a button is clicked. The quotes could be pulled from a database or a list stored in the JavaScript code.
    
4.  **<mark>A simple calculator</mark>**: This project would allow users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
    
5.  **<mark>A rock, paper, scissors game</mark>**: This project would allow users to play the classic game against the computer. It could include options for different game modes, such as best of three or best of five.
    
6.  **<mark>A tic-tac-toe game</mark>**: This project would allow users to play the classic game against the computer or another player. It could include options for different difficulty levels.
    
7.  **<mark>A random password generator</mark>**: This project would allow users to specify the length and complexity of the password they want to generate, and then display a randomly generated password meeting those criteria.
    
8.  **<mark>A simple chatbot</mark>**: This project would allow users to input text and receive a response from a chatbot programmed to respond to certain keywords or phrases.
    
9.  **<mark>A simple card game</mark>**: This project could be a version of a classic card game like solitaire or a simple game like war. It could include options for different difficulty levels.
    
10.  **<mark>A simple image gallery</mark>**: This project would allow users to browse a collection of images and display them in a grid or slideshow format. It could include options for filtering or sorting the images based on various criteria.

## Quote of the week

“Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight.” ―**Bill Gates**

That's all I have for this week until next week let's keep on hacking!
