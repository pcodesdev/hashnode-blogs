# Git and GitHub

## Git

According to **Wikipedia *Git*** is a [distributed version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control) system: tracks changes in any set of [files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file), usually used for coordinating work among [programmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer) collaboratively developing [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code) during [software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development). Its goals include speed, [data integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integrity), and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).

Git was originally authored by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) in 2005 for the development of the [Linux kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel), with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development. Since 2005, Junio Hamano has been the core maintainer. As with most other [distributed version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control) systems, and unlike most [client-server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server) systems, every Git [directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_(computing)) on every [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking)) is a full-fledged [repository](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repository_(version_control)) with complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server. Git is free [and open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) distributed under the [GPL-2.0-only](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) license.

Git makes it possible for a software developer to work collaboratively with other software developers by merging, committing and pushing new changes to the project under development.

For one to start using git it has to be installed locally from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/). When you visit the site select the appropriate git version according to your operating system. After downloading and installing git open your command terminal and run this command: <mark>git --version </mark> this displays the current git version on your machine.

Below is a list of major Git Commands:

*   <mark>git code.</mark> //*Open vs code*
    
*   <mark>git status</mark> //Show file status
    
*   <mark>git status -s</mark> //show short file status
    
*   <mark>git add &lt;filename&gt;</mark> //Add the particular file to the staging area
    
*   <mark>git add.</mark> //Add all the files to the staging area
    
*   <mark>git commit --amend</mark> //Add these changes to the last commit (will have to use vim editor)
    
*   <mark>git commit -m "message"</mark> //Commit the files in the staging area
    
*   <mark>git commit -am "message" </mark> //Will commit without adding the file to the staging area
    
*   <mark>git checkout --&lt;filename&gt;</mark> //will restore the file from the last commit
    
*   <mark>git checkout -f </mark> //All the files will be replaced with the last commit
    
*   <mark>git checkout -b</mark> &lt;branch name&gt; //Create a branch
    
*   <mark>git branch</mark> //To see the branches
    
*   <mark>git branch -d &lt;branch name&gt;</mark> //To delete a branch
    
*   <mark>git branch -v</mark> //will show the branch and its last commit
    
*   <mark>git branch --merged</mark> //will show the branches that are merged
    
*   <mark>git branch --no-merged </mark> //will show the branches that are not merged
    
*   <mark>git merge &lt;branch name&gt; </mark> //while in a branch you can merge another branch
    
*   <mark>git log</mark> //Show all the commits
    
*   <mark>git log -n</mark> //n can be replaced by any number "will show the last n commits"
    
*   <mark>git log -p</mark> //Will show a detailed description of the commits
    
*   <mark>git log -p -n</mark> //use of n is similar to described above
    
*   <mark>git log --stat </mark> //will show short detail of the commits
    
*   <mark>git log --stat -n</mark> //use of n is similar to described above
    
*   <mark>git log --since=n.days </mark> //commit of last n days/weeks/months "days can be replaced by weeks, months"
    
*   <mark>git rm --cached &lt;filename&gt;</mark> //will remove the file from the tracking area
    
*   <mark>git rm -rf </mark> //will uninitialized the current repository
    
*   <mark>git rm &lt;filename&gt;</mark> //will delete the file
    
*   <mark>git mv &lt;Present filename&gt; &lt;The filename after the change&gt;</mark> //to Rename the file
    
*   <mark>git clone &lt;URL&gt; </mark> //Cloning a repository in the current folder
    
*   <mark>git clone &lt;URL&gt; folder name</mark> //Cloning the repository in the given folder name (Folder will be created by itself)
    
*   <mark>git config --global alias. &lt;new name&gt; 'old command'</mark> //while creating an alias command for the given command
    
*   <mark>git remote</mark> //Show all the names of the remote repository
    
*   <mark>git remote -v</mark> //Show all the paths (fetch/push) of the remote repository
    
*   <mark>git remote add &lt;name&gt; url </mark> //Add a remote repository
    
*   <mark>git remote rm &lt;name&gt;</mark> //To remove a remote
    
*   <mark>git push &lt;remote name&gt; &lt;branch name&gt; </mark> //To push a branch to remote repository
    
*   <mark>git push &lt;remote name&gt; &lt;branch name&gt;:&lt;branch name you want to have in the remote repository&gt;</mark>
    
*   <mark>git reset HEAD</mark> //To move to a previous commit

## GitHub

GitHub is an [Internet hosting service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_hosting_service) for [software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development) and [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) using [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git). It provides the [distributed version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control) of Git plus [access control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control), [bug tracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_tracking_system), [software feature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_feature) requests, [task management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_management), [continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration), and [wikis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) for every project. GitHub is **a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration**. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. GitHub lets developers upload their code using various GIt commands to a remote repository(folder) where other developers can collaborate remotely.
